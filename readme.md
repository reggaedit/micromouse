# Micromouse code
This folder contains all the code for the micromouse maze solver. The mouse must be autonomous and find the centre in the first pass, then race to the center in consequent passes.

## Initial idea:
	- controlled by an mbed microcontroller
	- written in C++
	
## Current status
	- [ ] Create plan
	- [ ] Create specific, trackable, attainable, realistic list of goals
	- [ ] Get a motored vehicle to run using an mbed
	- [ ] Write pseudo code out in full
	- [ ] Create a working model of a mouse that moves and processes sensory input

## Build instructions
	- In Visual Studio - open solution and Build project.
